libquobf

From token to spell, libquobf makes every function castable.

libquobf is a modular transformation library built for GosiLang and gosi.exe runtimes. It turns code into encrypted, polymorphic logic through tokenization, AST parsing, and spell-based transformation.

🚀 Features

🔤 Token-to-spell mapping engine

🌲 AST-based logic manipulation

🔐 Obfuscation via truncate, collect, transform

✨ GosiLang spell scripting integration

🧠 Built for OBINexus program synthesis

🧩 Core Components

Module

Purpose

qutokenizer

Breaks input into categorized tokens

quparser

Creates AST from tokens

shadowcraft

Transforms AST nodes into obfuscated spells

libquobf.js

Executes transformation via gosi.exe

🛠️ Usage (via gosi.exe)

gosi.exe run libquobf.js < your_code.gosi

📦 Output Pipeline

.gosi → Tokenize → Parse → Spellify → Encrypted .js → Executed by gosi.exe

🎯 Ideal For

Quantum logic overlays

Secure script deployment

Obfuscated runtime behaviors

Creative coding in cryptographic environments
